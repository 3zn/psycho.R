The method agreement procedure
==============================

When running a factor analysis, one often needs to know how many components / latent variables to retain. Fortunately, many methods exist to statistically answer this question. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on which method to use. Therefore, the `n_factors()` function, available in the [psycho](https://github.com/neuropsychology/psycho.R) package, performs the **method agreement procedure**: it runs all the routines and returns the number of factors with the highest consensus.

``` r
# devtools::install_github("neuropsychology/psycho.R")  # Install the last psycho version if needed

library(tidyverse)
library(psycho)

results <- attitude %>%
  psycho::n_factors()

print(results)
```

    ## The choice of 1 factor is supported by 5 (out of 9; 55.56%) methods (Optimal Coordinates, Acceleration Factor, Parallel Analysis, Velicer MAP, VSS Complexity 1).

We can have an overview of all values by using the `summary` method.

|  n.Factors|  n.Methods|  Eigenvalues|  Cum.Variance|
|----------:|----------:|------------:|-------------:|
|          1|          5|         3.72|          0.53|
|          2|          3|         1.14|          0.69|
|          3|          1|         0.85|          0.81|
|          4|          0|         0.61|          0.90|
|          5|          0|         0.32|          0.95|
|          6|          0|         0.22|          0.98|
|          7|          0|         0.14|          1.00|

And, of course, plot it :)

``` r
plot(results)
```

The plot shows the **number of methods** (in yellow), the **Eigenvalues** (red line) and the cumulative proportion of **explained variance** (blue line).

For more details, we can also extract the final result (the optimal number of factors) for each method:

| Method                         |  n\_optimal|
|:-------------------------------|-----------:|
| Optimal Coordinates            |           1|
| Acceleration Factor            |           1|
| Parallel Analysis              |           1|
| Eigenvalues (Kaiser Criterion) |           2|
| Velicer MAP                    |           1|
| BIC                            |           2|
| Sample Size Adjusted BIC       |           3|
| VSS Complexity 1               |           1|
| VSS Complexity 2               |           2|

Tweaking
========

We can also provide a correlation matrix, as well as changing the rotation and the factoring method.

``` r
df <- psycho::affective

cor_mat <- psycho::correlation(df)
cor_mat <- cor_mat$values$r

results <- cor_mat %>%
  psycho::n_factors(rotate = "oblimin", fm = "mle", n=nrow(df))

print(results)
```

    ## The choice of 2 factors is supported by 5 (out of 9; 55.56%) methods (Parallel Analysis, Eigenvalues (Kaiser Criterion), BIC, Sample Size Adjusted BIC, VSS Complexity 2).

``` r
plot(results)
```
