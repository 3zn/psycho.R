# Contribution Guidelines
**All people are very much welcome to contribute to code, documentation, testing and suggestions.**



## Code
- Authors of code contribution will be added within the [**authors**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/psycho.R/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) section within the package description.
- Please document and comment your code, so that the purpose of each step (or code line) is stated in a clear and understandable way.
- Avoid unnecessary function splitting into smaller bits: it makes testing and reading of the code more difficult (as one must jump between functions and files to understand what's happening).
- Before submitting a change, please use [**styler**](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) to nicely format your code.
